        "On September 10th, 2024, iHeartMedia released its third quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024. The company reported total revenue of $98 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 1% compared to Q3 FY23.\n",
        "Despite the overall decline in revenue, iHeartMedia saw growth in certain areas of its business. For example, advertising revenue increased by nearly 5%, driven largely by political ad spending ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. Additionally, the company announced plans to launch several new podcast networks over the next few months, which could help drive future growth.\n",
        "However, it appears that iHeartMedia may be facing some challenges on the cost side of things. According to documents obtained from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the company ordered more than $13,000 worth of broadcast time on radio stations across the country during October 2024 - just one month after releasing their latest financial results.\n",
        "The orders were placed under the name \"Kamala Harris for President,\" suggesting they might have been related to campaign messaging leading up to Election Day. While we don't know exactly what these ads said or why they were so expensive, it seems likely that they played a role in helping boost iHeartMedia's bottom line during that period.\n",
        "Overall, while iHeartMedia had some good news amidst tough economic conditions earlier this week, it remains unclear whether those gains will continue into coming quarters as costs rise\n",
